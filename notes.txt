Why we need to connect our smart contract code to users wallet? 

To interact with the blockchain we need to connect to a node, Since these wallets are connected to the 
blockchain we can use them to allow users to connect to blockchain. 
In the backend we can use alchemy/infura to connect with the blockchain node[or run our own node] but in
the front end we use users metamask to connect them to the blockchain node[metamask under the hood uses infura].
All blockchain networks in metamask has a rpc url - infura in metamask

so we need to connect our sc with the metamask so that users can interact with it

How to code the logic to connect the smart contract with users wallet?

In FE there will be a connect button that allows us to connect with the metamask account, execute button 
to execute a txn in the metamask;

So how this buttons work under the hood

inspect > sources we'll see the metamask etc these are injected from the browser extension
    when our browser has these extensions installed, they automatically get injected into a "window" object
    in javascript 
    ie in console type: window -> we can see all the window objects
    type: window.ethereum -> returns an object if we have metamask installed
    similarlly check other wallets if any

## 6 methods to connect smartcontract to front end
 
1. HTML & javascript
2. NEXTJS / React and "Raw" ethers
3. NEXTJS & "web3-react"
4. NEXTJS & "react-moralis"
5. NEXTJS & "web3Modal"
6. NEXTJS & "useDapp"

1. HTML & javascript
    Create an index.js file and add the browser compatable js code here and export the function into html 

    src="./index.js" type="text/javascript"

    We need to check whether window.ethereum object exists
        if exist - send a request to it to get the accounts

    if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
      ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
    } - Wrap this into a button

    async function connect() {
        if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") { - we have a provider
          await ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" }); - we have account to work with
        }
    }
    <button id="connectButton" onclick="connect()">Connect</button>
    <button id="executeButton" onclick="execute()">Execute</button>

    Now we need another fn to execute transactions with the selected account
        use ethersjs or web3js package to do these transactions
        npm install --save-dev ethers

        grab the ethers package

        const {ethers} = require("ethers")

    To execute a fn we need a
      contract address, - npx hardhat node and deploy it to local http blockchain and get its address
      contract ABI, - to interact and call fns in the smartcontract
      function,
      node connection - metamask

## Whenever we want to interact/execute a fn in smartcontract we need 4 things:
    1. The contractAddress - The address of the deployed contract tells js which is the contract to interact with

    2. contract abi - While interacting the scripts/users needs to know which are the functions they can call or which
                      are the public variables they can read from and so on. Itâ€™s a way of describing the interface of
                      our contract. 
                      Our script/user is interacting with the abi which tells our app what functions can be called, 
                      how they can be called and what they return.

    3. provider - To interact with blockchain we need access to a node. Since the contract is executed/run on our device instead 
                  they run on EVM's on the blockchain, so we use node as a service provider platforms like Infuram, alchemy etc. 
                  In the front the users use metamask[which uses infura under the hood to help us connect to the blockchain] 
                  to interact with the smartcontract deployed on the blockchain. So metamask is the one providing users access so 
                  its a provider. We access the provider in our javascript code via the window.ethereum.
                  In backend to interact with a contract [ie Our apps backend should interact with blockchain to return data etc 
                  from the blockchain] we need to connect with the blockchain so we need the same 4 things. Here in frontend the 
                  provider will not be metamask it'll be alchemy or Infuram.

    4. Signer - Once we get the provider [that connects users to blockchain] we need a signer to sign transactions like calling a 
                function, writing data to blockchain etc since they require gas fees.
                In front end the signer will be the connected account [connected via provider metamask]. In backend its mostly the 
                person who deployed the contract. 

## Project
    npx hardhat node - first it spins up a fake blockchain in the terminal and it deploys the contracts
    and it gives us a bunch of fake accounts
    The fake blockchain node/ endpoint is running in our HTTP server 
    - http://127.0.0.1:8545/ add this endpoint to metamask in new rpc url
    chain id 31337, symbol ETH
    - For this blockchain we have 20 fake accounts with fake eth import a account to metamask

    Now we have address [we already have node connection]
    Get abi of deployed contract from contracts json file in deployments

    In the smartcontract there are public fns which we can call so we have a fn

    Stick our provider metamask to ethers

    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
        
        provider is metamask aka window.ethereum, ie we are using this as our rpc url
        we can also put the HTTP server rpc url, but we want to connect with users metamask, we want to connect
        with whatever network they are working with we dont always wanna force them to our localhost blockchain

    signer - when somebody execute a txn somebody needs to sign it

    const signer = provider.getSigner();
        This is going to get the connected account into our ethers

    Now put provider and signer into a contract 
        const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer)
            This means we're gonna be interacting with this contractAddress, using this abi, and any fn called
            will be called by the signer
            whoever connects() to the smart contract will be the signer and they are the one gonna call these fns

    await contract.store(42); //calling the store fn and passing a parameter

Now we can connect but when we try to execute the fn we'll get an error
    ReferenceError: Cannot access 'ethers' before initialization
    Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined

    This is because the require stuff doesnt work in the browsers, so we need to browserify our javascript.
    ie we need to take the index.js file and transpile it into a way that frontend can actually understand.

        npm install -g browserify

    To transpile index.js into browserified index.js - in git bash run :
        npx browserify index.js --standalone bundle -o ./dist/bundle.js

    Now in the html file change path to ./bundle.js and to execute a fn from bundle.js use dot(.) operator

        <script src="./bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <button id="connectButton" onclick="bundle.connect()">Connect</button>

Summary
-firstly create a basic index.html file with buttons to connect and execute functions, run it in live server

-Define the functions in the index.js file, a connect fn to check for an ethereum provider/ metamask and send a 
response, an execute fn to execute a txn. 

-To execute a blockchain transaction we need the contractAddress, abi, provider and signer.

-Now run "npx hardhat node" this will compile the contract and deploy it to a local hardhat blockchain copy this
deployed address into contractAddress, and the abi code will be present after compile, copy it as well.

-Now define the provider using ethers[install ethers], once provider is defined we can get the signer using the 
provider.getSigner();

-Now define the contract using ethers.

-Now call any public txn/fn.

-Export both connect and execute fns.

-Now if we try to connect it works but execute doesnt work cause the browser doesnt know require. 
so we need to transpile our js file so browser can understand. Install browserify, transpile the js file.

-Now go to the html file and change the path from index.js to bundle.js and since connect, execute fns are 
now part of bundle use dot(.) operator along with bundle to access those fns in the html file.


<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Nextjs is like react - run "npm run dev"

We need to create 2 fns connect and execute - same way as in html-js-ethers
Normal react would recognize window object but Nextjs wont so we need to do some workaround 

#   Make a button that will only exist if we are not connected ie once we are connected the 
    button should disappear so we need to save the state[ie whether connected or not] so later
    we can use that state to determine whether to display the button or not - so use useState
    const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);
        So now when we are connect change the state of setIsConnected to true

    we can do let isConnected = false; and achieve the same but, 
    Difference is useState help us to keep state between renders

    inside the request method in connect()
    setIsConnected(true); - we also use this connection to get a provider

    So if setIsConnected is true we get the provider by:
    let connectedProvider = new ethers.provider.web3Provider(window.ethereum); 

    since now we have the provider we can get the signer as well:
    setSigner(connectedProvider.getSigner());  
        store the state of signer: 
            const [signer, setSigner] = useState();
            Since signer fn is not in the execute fn. when we click the execute fn the execute fn 
            should know who the signer is so save it into a state. So now whenever the execute fn 
            is called the fn knows who the signer is 
        or
            set the provider and signer inside the execute fn

#   Now in the execute fn declare the contractAddress and abi. Then declare the contract 
        const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);

#   creating button for these functions
        <button onClick={() => connect()}>connect</button>
    
    To only show the button if you are connected
        {isConnected ? ("Connected!!") : (<button onClick={() => connect()}>connect</button>)}

    To show only the execute button once we are connected
        {isConnected ? (
        <>
          "Connected!!"
          <button onClick={() => execute()}>execute</button>
        </>
      ) : (button onClick={() => connect()}>connect</button>)}

Drawback is that when we switch pages we want the states to be saved like signer's etc and we dont want to clutter
everything with more code so we use other packages
